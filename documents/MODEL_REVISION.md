# Ko Alpaca Lingo
The term "Lingo" in the model name "KoAlpacaLingo" refers to the ability to handle specialized terms and expressions in specific fields. This model represents a model that is proficient in understanding and translating the language characteristics of specific domains in Korean translation tasks.
Through this experiment, we aim to translate and fine-tune the data using Alpaca for the purpose of generating natural Korean language models (LLMs). Additionally, we will explore the possibility of fine-tuning with limited GPU resources.
After using the translator to translate the contents of SharGPT, an alpaca model fine-tuned specifically for language translation tasks.

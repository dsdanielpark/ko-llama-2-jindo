Through this experiment, we aim to translate and fine-tune the data using Alpaca for the purpose of generating natural Korean language models (LLMs) in English. Additionally, we will explore the possibility of fine-tuning with limited GPU resources.
After using the translator to translate the contents of SharGPT, an alpaca model fine-tuned specifically for language translation tasks.
